            <p>While you <a href="/documentation/controllers">controllers</a> contain the logic, your views take the data passed to them and display it in a meaningful way.</p>

            <p>For websites, this might be in HTML and for apps or APIs this could be in XML or JSON.</p>

            <p>Views should be built in a way that works best for you. In the case of Wayfinder's documentation, the header, body and footer of a page are split into three separate blocks. This helps keep the common code reusable and organised.</p>
